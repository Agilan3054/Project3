# EMAIL Spam Detection 

This project is a Python-based spam detection system using machine learning. It's designed to classify whether an email message is spam or not. We've used the `emails.csv` dataset as the source of email data.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To build a machine learning model that can accurately classify emails as either spam or not spam (ham).

- **Dataset**: We have used the `emails.csv` dataset, which contains labeled email messages.

- **Tools and Libraries**: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, NLTK
